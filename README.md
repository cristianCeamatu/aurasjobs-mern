> ### This project is a rebuild version of the single-page website [aurasjobs.ro](https://github.com/cristianCeamatu/aurasjobs.ro-laravel) which is built with Laravel/PHP. The original app is used in production for a Recruiting agency, candidates can apply directly through a form on the website. The client will receive an email for each application or contact request, currently working on an admin page where he can manage the database of the candidate's applications and contact requests. The website is mobile responsive.

### This website was created in order to change the stack of the original website from Laravel to MERN.
